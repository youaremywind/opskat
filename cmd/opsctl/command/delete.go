// handler's own design, "恒需确认，不可 grant": handleDeleteAsset/handleDeleteGroup
// call permission.RequireChecker unconditionally and always invoke its ConfirmFunc —
// there is no branch that lets a caller skip confirmation, unlike every other
// dispatch through callHandler (which only ever marks WithPreapproved, an exemption
// those two handlers do not accept).
//
// From opsctl's process there is no PolicyChecker to find: permission.WithPolicyChecker
// is only ever called from the desktop AI chat session (internal/app/ai/chat.go) —
// opsctl has no equivalent, so RequireChecker would fail closed with "permission
// checker not available" even after a user has approved via requireApproval.
// withPreapprovedDeleteChecker below closes that gap: it installs a checker whose
// ConfirmFunc auto-allows, but only ever after deleteApprovalFn has already gotten
// the user's real, interactive approval from the running desktop app. That approval
// (not the auto-allow checker) is the one and only confirmation gate — see
// task-11-report.md for the full investigation.

func printDeleteUsage() {
	fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, `Usage:
  opsctl delete <resource> <ref> [flags]

Resources:
  asset     Delete an asset (soft-delete; connection config is cleared)
  group     Delete a group (assets move to ungrouped unless --delete-assets)

Run 'opsctl delete group --help' for group-specific flags.

Approval:
  Always requires desktop app confirmation — this cannot be pre-approved or
  granted, even with an active session.

Examples:
  opsctl delete asset old-server
  opsctl delete asset 1
  opsctl delete group 3
  opsctl delete group staging --delete-assets
`)
}

func printDeleteGroupUsage() {
	fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, `Usage:
  opsctl delete group <ref> [flags]

Arguments:
  ref       Group name, path, or numeric ID

Flags:
  --delete-assets   Also delete every asset in this group (irreversible from
                    the app). Default: assets move to ungrouped and survive.

Approval:
  Always requires desktop app confirmation — this cannot be pre-approved or
  granted, even with an active session.

Examples:
  opsctl delete group 3
  opsctl delete group staging --delete-assets
`)
}
