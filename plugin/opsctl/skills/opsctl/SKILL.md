# opsctl CLI Tool

Standalone CLI for asset management and remote operations without the GUI. All managed assets (servers, databases, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, Kubernetes, etcd, ...) are stored in the desktop app — use `list`/`get` to discover available targets before operating, and `help <asset-or-type>` to learn a type's config and command contract.

## Global Flags

- `--data-dir <path>` — Override app data directory
- `--master-key <key>` — Master encryption key (env: `OPSKAT_MASTER_KEY`)
- `--session <id>` — Session ID for batch approval (env: `OPSKAT_SESSION_ID`)

## Asset Resolution

Assets can be referenced by:
- **Numeric ID**: `opsctl get asset 1`
- **Name**: `opsctl get asset web-server`
- **Group/Name path**: `opsctl get asset production/web-01`

## Type Assertions

**When the asset type is known, always include a type assertion.** This catches
a target/type mismatch before policy checks, approval, or execution. Assertions
never select the protocol: dispatch still comes from the asset record.

- Single command: `opsctl exec <asset> --type <asset-type> -- <command>`
- Positional batch: `<asset-type>:<asset>:<command>`
- JSON batch: include `"type":"<asset-type>"` on every known-type item

Prefer canonical asset types (`ssh`, `database`, `redis`, `mongodb`, `etcd`,
`kafka`, `k8s`, `serial`). Compatibility aliases (`exec`, `sql`, `mongo`) are
accepted, but canonical names make the AI's intent clear. Omit the assertion
only when the type is genuinely unknown; use `get asset` to discover it first
when practical.

## Context Efficiency

Minimize output to save context window:
- **Filter lists**: `opsctl list assets --type ssh --group-id 2` instead of unfiltered `list assets` when the target type/group is known.
- **Targeted get**: Use `get asset <name>` for a single asset instead of listing all then filtering.
- **Batch over sequential**: One `opsctl batch` call returns structured JSON — more compact than N separate `exec` outputs with shell overhead.
- **Pipe to grep/head**: When only partial output is needed, pipe remote commands: `opsctl exec web --type ssh -- "tail -50 /var/log/app.log"` instead of dumping entire logs.

## Approval Mechanism

Most write operations require desktop app approval.

**Flow**: policy check → grant pattern match → session auto-approve → desktop app approval dialog.

- **Queue mode**: Multiple concurrent approval requests are queued into a single dialog. User can approve/deny individually or batch "Approve All" / "Deny All".
- **Offline**: Policy/grant matches still auto-approve; otherwise rejects. CP/Create/Update always need desktop app. **Delete always needs desktop app too, and cannot be pre-approved or granted even with an active session** — there is no "allow all" for it.
- **Pre-approve patterns**: Use `grant submit` or `request_permission` tool to submit command patterns (supports `*` wildcard). Approved patterns auto-pass subsequent matching commands.

## Sessions

Sessions auto-create on first write — do NOT manually `session start`. "Allow Session" in the first approval dialog auto-approves subsequent operations. Sessions expire after 24 hours.

For explicit session management, grant workflow, and details, see [references/commands.md](references/commands.md).

## Parallel Execution

**Preferred: `opsctl batch`** — Execute multiple commands against any asset type (ssh, database, redis, mongodb, etcd, kafka, k8s, ...) in a single invocation with one approval dialog and parallel execution. This avoids approval race conditions and process-level failures.

```bash
# Args mode: mark every item whose type is known.
opsctl batch 'ssh:web-01:uptime' 'database:db-01:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users' 'redis:cache:PING'

# JSON stdin mode (AI-friendly)
echo '{"commands":[
  {"asset":"web-01","type":"ssh","command":"uptime"},
  {"asset":"db-01","type":"database","command":"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users"},
  {"asset":"cache","type":"redis","command":"PING"}
]}' | opsctl batch
```

Output is structured JSON with per-command results (`exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `error`).

**Alternative: Parallel sub-agents** — For operations that `batch` doesn't support (e.g., `cp`, `create`), dispatch parallel sub-agents. The desktop app queues concurrent approval requests into a single dialog with "Approve All" / "Deny All" buttons.

**Setup for sub-agents**: Ensure approval is handled before parallelizing:
- **Option A**: Run one command first → user selects "Allow Session" → subsequent commands auto-approve
- **Option B**: `grant submit` patterns for all targets upfront → all matching commands auto-approve

**Parallelizable scenarios**: batch `init`, same command on N servers, multi-target file transfers, independent database queries.

## Commands

Core commands: `list`, `get`, `help`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `ssh`, `exec`, `batch`, `cp`, `grant`, `session`, `ext`, `version`.

For full command reference with flags and examples, see [references/commands.md](references/commands.md).

## Init — Asset Environment Discovery

`/opsctl:init` — Auto-discover server environment via SSH and update asset descriptions. Supports single asset or batch group processing.

## Error Handling

- **User rejection** (output contains "user denied execution" or "user denied grant approval"): Stop the entire task immediately. Report the denied command and wait for user instructions. Do NOT retry, work around, or continue with remaining steps.
- **SSH connection failure**: Report the error, check asset config with `get asset`. Do not retry blindly — ask user if host/credentials changed.
- **Partial batch failure**: `batch` returns per-command results. Report failed commands with their errors, summarize successes. Ask user how to proceed with failures.
- **Command not found on remote**: Suggest installing the missing tool or an alternative command. Do not assume package managers.

## Common Workflows

### Fleet Diagnostics

```bash
# Check disk/memory across all production servers
opsctl batch 'ssh:web-01:df -h && free -h' 'ssh:web-02:df -h && free -h' 'ssh:db-01:df -h && free -h'
```

### Deploy Config → Restart Service

```bash
# 1. Pre-approve the operations
opsctl grant submit web-01 web-02 "tee /etc/app/config.yml" "systemctl restart app"

# 2. Deploy (all auto-approved by grant)
cat config.yml | opsctl exec web-01 --type ssh -- tee /etc/app/config.yml
cat config.yml | opsctl exec web-02 --type ssh -- tee /etc/app/config.yml
opsctl batch 'ssh:web-01:systemctl restart app' 'ssh:web-02:systemctl restart app'
```

### Cross-Environment Data Migration

```bash
# Export from staging, import to prod (direct streaming, no local disk)
opsctl exec staging-db --type ssh -- "mysqldump -u app dbname | gzip" > /tmp/dump.sql.gz
opsctl exec prod-db --type ssh -- "gunzip | mysql -u app dbname" < /tmp/dump.sql.gz

# Or query + transfer
opsctl exec staging-db --type database -- "SELECT * FROM config WHERE env='staging'"
opsctl cp staging:/var/backups/db.sql prod:/var/tmp/db.sql
```

### Batch Server Setup

```bash
# Create assets → init discovery (use parallel sub-agents for create)
opsctl create asset --name web-03 --host 10.0.1.3 --username root
opsctl create asset --name web-04 --host 10.0.1.4 --username root
# Then batch init with /opsctl:init --group <group-id>
```
