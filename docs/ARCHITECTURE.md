# Architecture

The canonical map of how OpsKat is put together: the processes it runs, the backend layering, the request lifecycle, each subsystem, the data model, and the AI / extension / opsctl flows.

> This doc owns **structure** (what the pieces are and how they fit). It does *not* repeat the cross-cutting **principles** (SOLID seams, Fix policy, Reuse first, defensive code) — those live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — nor the **how-to** (commands, conventions, logging rules, generated files) — those live in [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md). The step-by-step path for adding a built-in asset type is in [adding-an-asset-type.md](references/adding-an-asset-type.md).

> **Keep it true for the current branch.** Every claim here must be verifiable in committed code. Counts (asset types, migrations, stores) are deliberately written as "enumerate from `<source>`" rather than hardcoded — they drift silently. Before editing, read [DOC-MAINTENANCE.md](DOC-MAINTENANCE.md).

## 1. Topology — desktop app and opsctl, no app HTTP API

OpsKat is a **Wails v2** desktop app (Go 1.26 backend + React 19 frontend). The frontend and backend communicate over **Wails IPC only** — there is no REST/HTTP server for the app's own UI. `opsctl` talks to the running app over two **Unix-domain sockets**, and extensions run as sandboxed **WASM** modules inside the backend.

   opsctl CLI  ── headless asset ops (exec / create / update / delete / cp / batch) ──►
   (cmd/opsctl, also embeddable in the app via internal/embedded)
```

- **Desktop app** — the Wails process. Owns the DB, credential keys, connection pools, the AI runner, and the WASM extension runtime.
- **`opsctl` CLI** — a standalone binary (`cmd/opsctl`) for headless/scripted asset operations. It reuses the running app's SSH connections and asks the app for approval over Unix sockets; it degrades to a limited offline mode when the app isn't running. Can be embedded in the app (`internal/embedded`, build tag `embed_opsctl`) and installed to the user's PATH.
- **Extensions** — WASM modules loaded by `pkg/extension` (wazero runtime). The host exposes a narrow capability surface; the AI calls extension tools through a single dispatcher.
- **`devserver`** (`cmd/devserver`) is a **dev-only** single-extension harness with its own local HTTP API — not part of the shipped app. See [§7](#7-extensions--wasm-plugins).

## 2. Backend layering

Bindings stay thin: parse → delegate → return. Business rules live in `service/`, persistence in `repository/`. **Logic placed directly in an `App` binding is unreachable from tests and from `opsctl`** — so it doesn't belong there.

```
main.go
  └─ internal/app/        IPC boundary (Wails-bound structs, "binders")  ── validate here
       └─ internal/service/        *_svc — business logic, validation, orchestration
            └─ internal/repository/    interface + impl + mock — data access
                 └─ internal/model/entity/   GORM entities
```

**Dependency rule (DIP).** A layer depends on the **interface getter** of the layer below, never on a concrete struct. Services call `asset_repo.Asset()` (the `AssetRepo` interface), repositories reach GORM through cago's `db.Ctx(ctx)`. Implementations are swapped behind the interface in tests via the generated `mock_*/` packages. A service must not import another service's repository or call back into `App`; `internal/app/*` must not touch repositories or the DB directly.

**Registration, not branching (OCP).** Repositories and services are wired as global singletons at startup: `RegisterXxx(NewXxx())` installs the implementation, `Xxx()` returns it. New protocol behavior plugs in by *registering* (an asset-type handler, an AI tool, a policy) — not by adding a `switch assetType` to shared code. See [AGENTS.md → SOLID](../AGENTS.md#high-cohesion-low-coupling--solid) for the seams this enforces.

**Underlying framework.** The backend is built on the **cago** framework (`github.com/cago-frame/cago`): DB registration/access (`db.Database()` / `db.Ctx(ctx)`), the structured logger (`pkg/logger`), config sources, and the AI agent loop (`coding` / `agent` packages, see [§6](#6-ai-subsystem)).

## 3. Request lifecycle

A representative read, traced front to back:

1. **Frontend** calls a generated Wails binding, e.g. `System.GetAsset(id)` from `frontend/wailsjs/go/system/System` (the `wailsjs/` bindings are **generated & gitignored** — the producer is the Go side in `internal/app/*.go`).
2. **Binding** (`internal/app/system/asset.go`) — a thin method on the bound `System` struct. It wraps the Wails context with the current language (`i18n.Ctx(s.ctx, s.Lang())`) and delegates: `asset_svc.Asset().Get(ctx, id)`. Boundary inputs are validated here / in the service; this is one of the **validate-at-the-boundary** points (alongside WASM host calls — see [AGENTS.md → Defensive Code](../AGENTS.md#defensive-code--error-handling-no-meaningless-fallbacks)).
3. **Service** (`internal/service/asset_svc`) — runs business logic (validation, defaults, e.g. seeding the default command policy on create), then calls the repository interface getter `asset_repo.Asset()`.
4. **Repository** (`internal/repository/asset_repo`) — issues the GORM query through `db.Ctx(ctx)`, filtering on `status = StatusActive` (soft delete, [§5](#5-data--persistence)).
5. **Return** — entity → service → binding → Wails marshals JSON → frontend store updates → subscribed components re-render.

Backend-initiated updates flow the other way as **events**: the app emits a Wails event (e.g. `data:changed`) and the frontend re-fetches via `EventsOn` (see [§8](#8-frontend)).

## 4. Process wiring (`main.go`)

`main.go` is the composition root. In order, it: resolves the data dir / master key (`OPSKAT_DATA_DIR` / `OPSKAT_MASTER_KEY` override; otherwise `bootstrap.AppDataDir()` returns the **portable** dir — `data/` next to the executable, see `internal/pkg/portable` — and falls back to the per-platform dir); runs `bootstrap.Init` (master-key resolve, DB open, repository registration, migrations); initializes the logger and config; builds the shared infrastructure (SSH pool, SFTP service); constructs the per-domain **binders** and hands them to `wails.Run` via `Bind`.

**Portable mode** shapes three more decisions, all of which must keep the host machine untouched and let the folder travel. `bootstrap.Init` keeps the master key in `<dataDir>/master.key` instead of the OS keychain — keyed off the *resolved* data dir, so an explicit `--data-dir` / `OPSKAT_DATA_DIR` pointing at an installed dir still uses the keychain. The two below instead key off `internal/pkg/portable` alone, which an override does not move. `main.go` then points WebView2's user-data dir at `<portable>/webview2` (Wails otherwise defaults it to `%APPDATA%\opskat.exe`, which would strand the frontend's `localStorage` — open tabs, editor buffers — on the host), and salts the `SingleInstanceLock` id with the portable path so a portable build started next to an installed one gets its own window instead of silently handing off and exiting. `OPSKAT_E2E` relaxes the single-instance lock for the e2e harness.

Binders implement a small `Lifecycle` (`Startup(ctx)` / `Cleanup()`) that `main.go` drives explicitly from Wails' `OnStartup` / `OnShutdown` hooks (Wails does not auto-call lifecycle methods on bound structs). The extension subsystem is initialized **asynchronously after startup** so WASM compilation never blocks the UI coming up.

## 5. Data & persistence

- **Store:** GORM over **SQLite** (`opskat.db` in the data dir), opened during `bootstrap.Init` and registered as the cago `db` singleton.
- **Migrations:** `gormigrate` (`go-gormigrate/gormigrate/v2`), one append-only list in `migrations/migrations.go`, run from bootstrap. New migrations are **appended**; old files never change. Enumerate them from `git ls-files 'migrations/*.go'` — don't hardcode a count.
- **Soft delete:** via a `Status` field, **not** GORM's `DeletedAt`. `StatusActive = 1` / `StatusDeleted = 2` are defined in `internal/model/entity/asset_entity/asset.go`; queries filter `status = StatusActive`. (Distinct from `internal/status/`, which is unrelated system-health reporting.)
- **Entities:** one package per domain under `internal/model/entity/` — enumerate with `git ls-tree --name-only -d HEAD internal/model/entity/` (asset, credential, group, policy_group, conversation, audit, grant, host_key, forward, ai_provider, snippet, extension_state, extension_data, and the shared `policy` package).
- **Credential encryption:** done in `internal/service/credential_svc` — **Argon2id** to derive a key from the master key + a per-install KDF salt, then **AES-256-GCM** for each secret. The **master key** is resolved by `credential_svc.ResolveMasterKey` (priority: explicit arg/env → OS keychain via `zalando/go-keyring` → `<dataDir>/master.key` file → freshly generated). `internal/bootstrap` only *resolves and injects* the key + salt (the KDF salt is persisted base64 in `config.json`); the crypto itself lives in `credential_svc`.

> "Command policy" is three different things — don't conflate them: (1) the shell-rule matching engine in `internal/ai/policy/command_rule.go` + `command_shell.go` (there is **no** `command_policy.go` source file); (2) the `command_policy` JSON column on the assets table (`asset_entity.Asset.CmdPolicy`); (3) `asset_entity.DefaultCommandPolicy`, a re-export of `policy.DefaultCommandPolicy` from `internal/model/entity/policy`.

## 6. AI subsystem

`internal/ai/` turns a conversation into guarded tool calls against assets. Its subpackages (enumerate with `git ls-tree --name-only -d HEAD internal/ai/`):

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `runner` | Builds the cago `coding.System` + `agent.Runner` (provider, tools, middleware) and drives Send/Cancel/Steer. Registers an **audit middleware** around every tool call and an optional gate for local file/shell tools. |
| `tool` | The tool registry. `Tools()` exposes the asset / group / exec / extension / transfer tools to the AI as cago `tool.Tool`s. The unified `exec` / `help` pair is the only AI command path for built-in asset types with an executor; `AllToolDefs()` is the name→handler table shared with opsctl, while opsctl keeps its own batch command. Extensions are reached through the single `ext_exec` dispatcher rather than one AI tool per extension. |
| `policy` | Per-protocol rule checkers — `query_policy.go` (SQL, parsed with the TiDB parser), `redis_policy.go`, `mongo_policy.go`, `k8s_policy.go`, `kafka_policy.go`, plus shell-command rules in `command_rule.go` / `command_shell.go` (shell AST via `mvdan.cc/sh`). |
| `permission` | Dispatches an asset type to its policy checker, merges asset + group-chain effective policy, and returns Allow / Deny / NeedConfirm. Owns the grant flow (matching previously-approved DB grants, submitting new ones for approval). File transfer is its own registered face, `cp`: the subject is the **remote path** rather than a command, it consults only grants (command-shaped policy rules don't apply to paths), and matching uses `policy.MatchPathRule`. Grant matching isolates the `cp` surface from all non-`cp` command surfaces so a path grant can never authorize a command, or the reverse; strict per-type isolation among non-`cp` grants is deferred because existing rows were stored as `tool_name="exec"`. |
| `helper` | Protocol clients (SSH, SQL, Redis, Mongo, Kafka, etcd, Serial, K8s). **No entry point here checks permissions.** The `Exec*OnAsset` functions are pure execution bodies; the check happens in `tool.handleExec` before dispatch. Calling one from a new site without a `permission` check bypasses policy. Enumerate them with `git grep -n "^func Exec.*OnAsset" -- internal/ai/helper/`. (RDP, VNC, and built-in OSS browsing are interactive app surfaces rather than AI helpers.) |
| `audit` | Writes a tool-call audit log after execution, with per-tool command-summary extractors. Also the entry point for the desktop binder's asset create/update/delete rows (`WriteAssetChange`), so all three `audit_logs.source` values (`ai` / `opsctl` / `desktop`) share one set of column semantics. |
| `aictx` | Shared context keys and the decision primitives (Allow / Deny / NeedConfirm, the `CheckResult` slot) used across the packages above. |
| `assetref` | Resolves the `asset` tool argument (numeric id **or** name) to an `*asset_entity.Asset`; a name matching more than one asset is an error rather than a silent first-match. Used by `exec` / `help` / `batch_exec` and by the audit middleware. |
| `skills` | Embeds one `<asset-type>/SKILL.md` per type documenting its `exec` command syntax (cago skill format: frontmatter + body). `help` serves the body; the prompt lists only the one-line description. |
| `execimpl` | Registers `helper` execution bodies and per-type help documents with `permission`. Giving a new asset type command support means adding its `SKILL.md` and registering its executor plus any canonicalizer or precheck here; types without a command surface register help only. |

**Tool-call flow:** the LLM emits a tool use → cago's loop runs the middleware chain → the handler asks `permission` to check the asset's policy → **Allow** runs it; **Deny** returns a refusal to the model; **NeedConfirm** prompts the user (and, on "allow all", persists a **grant** so future matching calls skip the prompt) → the result and the recorded decision (source + matched pattern) are written to the audit log. Extension tool calls go through `ext_exec`, which resolves the extension, checks its declared policy type against the asset's policy groups, then calls `Plugin.CallTool`. `upload_file` / `download_file` run the same gate under the `cp` face before opening the SFTP connection, so a transfer is prompted and audited exactly like a command; `opsctl cp` requests the same approval type over `approval.sock`.

**The unified `exec` tool's ordering is load-bearing** (`tool/tool_handlers_unified.go`): resolve the asset and optional type assertion → validate a non-empty command → look up its executor → enforce the per-conversation **doc gate** → canonicalize when the type registered a `CanonicalizeFunc` → run any per-type `PrecheckFunc` → **then** perform the permission check and execute. Every side-effect-free judgement must run before `CheckForAsset`, because `NeedConfirm` blocks on a user-visible approval dialog whose "allow all" may persist a grant. Policy matching, the approval dialog, and audit use the canonicalized command; execution receives the raw command. Pre-permission failures record a deny decision with an `exec_*` source so audit can distinguish them from execution. The permission lookup itself is fail-closed: ordinary callers require an injected checker, while opsctl may omit it only on a context explicitly marked as already approved.

For the exact logging obligations on this path, see [DEVELOP.md → Logging for key flows](DEVELOP.md#logging-for-key-flows).

## 7. Extensions — WASM plugins

`pkg/extension/` is a **wazero** WASM runtime. Each extension ships a `manifest.json` declaring its tools (JSON-Schema params), asset types, capabilities, and policy type; the WASM module exports an `execute_tool` entry. Key files: `runtime.go` (compile/instantiate, `Plugin.CallTool`), `manifest.go` (parse + capability checks), `host.go` / `hostfn.go` / `host_default.go` (the host capability surface), `bridge.go` (registry of loaded extensions, their tools, asset types, and policy groups), `manager.go` (scan/load/watch the extensions dir).

**Host capability surface** (declared in the manifest, enforced at each host call): scoped filesystem read/write, HTTP (allowlist; private networks rejected unless tunneled), TCP, asset-config access (credential fields decrypted only with the `credentials: read` capability), KV storage (per-value / per-extension quotas), native file dialogs, logging, and action events/cancellation. Each tool call instantiates a **fresh** module — plugins keep no in-process state between calls.

**Lifecycle:** `internal/service/extension_svc` scans the extensions dir at startup, applies enabled/disabled state from `extension_state_repo`, and registers enabled extensions into the `Bridge`; KV data is persisted via `extension_data_repo`. Enable / disable / install / uninstall mutate the bridge and persist state. The AI side is wired by handing the `Bridge` to `tool.SetExecToolExecutor` (the `ext_exec` executor) once the service is ready.

**`cmd/devserver`** runs a *single* extension in isolation for development (`make devserver EXT=<name>`, refuses when `OPSKAT_ENV=production`). It serves a local HTTP API + WebSocket event stream and embeds its own UI (`frontend/packages/devserver-ui`, built to a generated `dist/`). This is a dev tool, separate from the shipped app's IPC-only model.

## 8. opsctl & the multi-process flow

`opsctl` performs asset operations headlessly while the desktop app remains the broker for connections and approvals. It shares the same bootstrap (DB, credentials) and talks to the running app over two Unix sockets, both under the data dir and mode-0600, authenticated with a token file written at startup:

- **`approval.sock`** (`internal/approval`, server started from `internal/app/opsctl`) — line-delimited JSON request/response. When a command needs confirmation, opsctl sends an `ApprovalRequest` (exec / cp / create / update / delete / grant / batch / ext_tool); the app emits a Wails event, the UI shows the dialog, and the decision (plus any user-edited grant patterns) is returned. Approved **grants** are persisted via `grant_repo` so later matching commands are auto-approved.
- **`sshpool.sock`** (`internal/sshpool`) — a framed binary proxy. opsctl asks the app to run exec / upload / download / copy over an **already-open** pooled SSH connection instead of dialing (and re-authenticating) itself.

`internal/sshpool` pools live SSH clients (ref-counted, idle-reaped). `internal/pkg/proxychain` composes ordered SSH, SOCKS5, and HTTP-script layers; `credential_resolver.ResolveProxyChain` resolves referenced SSH assets and secrets once, and `internal/connpool.ProxyChainDialContext` adapts the result for protocol and HTTP transports. Database, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka (brokers plus Schema Registry and Connect), etcd, RDP, Kubernetes, and the cached S3-compatible clients use that path. Local SQLite does not; remote SQLite VFS accesses its file through the selected pooled SSH asset, so that SSH asset owns the network chain. The RDP app service streams framebuffer dirty regions, pointer/input events, and clipboard text/files over Wails events; the VNC app service composes the same proxy chain but dials the RFB endpoint directly from `vnc_svc` and bridges the raw RFB byte stream to the in-app noVNC client over Wails events (with an optional SSH/SFTP file channel); the OSS app/service exposes the built-in bucket/object browser, transfer queue, copy/move/delete, previews, and presigned URLs over Wails IPC. A presigned URL opened by an external browser does not inherit the app's in-process proxy chain. None of RDP, VNC, or OSS currently has a built-in policy kind or a dedicated opsctl operation command. When the app isn't running, opsctl falls back to `pkg/client` (direct SSH with TOFU known-hosts) and a local policy/grant check for the operations that allow offline use.

End to end — `opsctl exec <asset> -- <cmd>`: resolve asset → local policy check → if NeedConfirm, request approval over `approval.sock` (UI prompt) → on approval, execute over `sshpool.sock` against the pooled connection (falling back to a direct dial if the socket is unavailable) → stream stdout/stderr/exit, write the audit log.

## 9. Frontend

`frontend/` is a **pnpm workspace** (Vite 6, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui over Radix, Zustand 5). The root app lives in `frontend/src/`; `frontend/packages/ui` is the shared `@opskat/ui` component library (consumed by both the app and `devserver-ui`); `frontend/packages/devserver-ui` is the separate UI embedded by `cmd/devserver`.

- **No React Router.** Navigation is a custom tab system in `tabStore`; tab kinds are the `TabType` union `"terminal" | "ai" | "query" | "page" | "info"`, each with its own metadata. Tab state persists to localStorage for session restore.
- **One Zustand store per domain** in `frontend/src/stores/` (enumerate with `git ls-files 'frontend/src/stores/*.ts'`). Components depend on stores/hooks, not on sibling components' internals; shared domain state and selectors live in stores. A stateful pane may own its view-local IPC/event lifecycle when that lifecycle is not shared, as `RDPPanel` and `VNCPanel` do for one mounted RDP or VNC session.
- **Backend bridge:** the generated, gitignored `frontend/wailsjs/go/<domain>/*` bindings call into the matching `internal/app/<domain>` binder; backend→frontend push uses `EventsOn` / `EventsOff` against events the app emits.
- **i18n:** i18next with locales `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{zh-CN,en}/common.json`, single namespace `common`, keys via `t("key.subkey")`.
- **Tests:** Vitest + happy-dom + React Testing Library; the Wails runtime and bindings are mocked in `frontend/src/__tests__/setup.ts`.
